# **TFLite Object Detection Model: Custom Object Detection with TensorFlow Lite**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates how to implement a custom object detection model using **TensorFlow Lite** for edge devices such as mobile and embedded systems. The model is trained on a custom dataset and optimized for performance through quantization to reduce its size, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The project involves evaluating the model’s accuracy using **mean average precision (mAP)**, a common metric for object detection tasks.

## **Architecture**

### **Model Architecture:**
- **Backbone Network:** The object detection model utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** as the core feature extractor.
- **Transfer Learning:** A pre-trained model such as **MobileNetV2** is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to adapt the model to detect specific objects.
- **Quantization:** The TensorFlow Lite version of the model is **quantized** for efficiency, reducing model size and inference time without significantly sacrificing accuracy.

### **Workflow:**
1. **Data Preparation:** Images are annotated with bounding boxes using tools like LabelImg.
2. **Model Training:** The object detection model is trained using TensorFlow, leveraging transfer learning.
3. **Model Conversion:** The trained model is converted to **TensorFlow Lite format (TFLite)** to optimize for edge device deployment.
4. **Evaluation:** The model's accuracy is measured using mAP on a test dataset.

## **Machine Learning Techniques**

### **Algorithms and Techniques:**
1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**
   - Used for image feature extraction and object localization.
   - The CNN backbone processes input images and detects objects based on learned patterns.
   
2. **Transfer Learning:**
   - The model leverages pre-trained weights from **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight network, to transfer knowledge learned from large-scale datasets.
   
3. **Quantization:**
   - Post-training quantization is applied to the model to reduce its size and speed up inference, which is particularly useful for deployment on mobile and IoT devices.
   
4. **Mean Average Precision (mAP):**
   - The model’s performance is evaluated using the **mAP** metric. This measures how well the model predicts object bounding boxes and classifies objects in images.

## **Custom Object Detection with TensorFlow Lite**

### **Supported Models**:
- **SSD-MobileNet**: A lightweight, real-time object detection model.
- **EfficientDet**: A more accurate model optimized for computational efficiency.

## **Architecture and Approach**

The core architecture leverages the **Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD)** with a **MobileNet** backbone. SSD is a well-known object detection architecture that strikes a good balance between speed and accuracy by predicting bounding boxes directly from feature maps of different sizes.

- **SSD-MobileNet**: Combines SSD with MobileNet, a lightweight network ideal for mobile and edge applications.
- **EfficientDet**: A more accurate and efficient detector that utilizes the **BiFPN** (Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network) for efficient multi-scale feature fusion.

Once the models are trained, they are converted to **TensorFlow Lite** format for deployment. **TFLite** optimizes the model for low-latency, low-power environments, making it ideal for mobile and embedded devices.

## **ML Algorithms**

### **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector):**
- Detects objects in a **single forward pass** through the network.
- Uses multiple feature maps of different sizes to predict objects at different scales.
  
### **MobileNet:**
- A **lightweight deep neural network** known for being efficient in terms of speed and size.
- Serves as the backbone for feature extraction in SSD.

### **EfficientDet:**
- Another object detection architecture designed for **efficiency**.
- Combines accuracy and speed with minimal computational overhead using the **BiFPN** for better feature fusion across different resolutions.

## **Training Process**

The training process involves:

1. **Custom Dataset**: A dataset of labeled images used for object detection.
2. **TensorFlow Object Detection API**: Leverages predefined architectures like SSD-MobileNet and EfficientDet for simplifying the training process on custom datasets.
3. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on the custom dataset for **faster convergence** and better generalization on new objects.

## **TFLite Model Conversion**

After training, the model is converted to **TensorFlow Lite** format using the **TensorFlow Lite Converter**, which optimizes the model for mobile and edge devices by reducing its size and improving performance without significant accuracy loss.

### **Deployment Targets**:
- **Android Phones**: The TFLite model can be integrated into mobile apps via Android Studio or ML Kit.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Use the TensorFlow Lite Python API to deploy models on Raspberry Pi or other IoT devices.

## **Model Evaluation**

We evaluate the model's performance using the **mAP** score, which is computed by comparing the ground truth bounding boxes with the model's predicted bounding boxes on a test dataset.

To compute the mAP score, the model predictions are compared against ground truth annotations using a custom evaluation script. The process involves:
- Running inference on a set of test images.
- Generating bounding box predictions.
- Calculating the mAP using a specialized evaluation tool.
